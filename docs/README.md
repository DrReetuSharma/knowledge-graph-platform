# Knowledge Graph Integration for Drug Discovery

The Knowledge Graph Integration for Drug Discovery project aims to develop a modular platform that enhances data sharing and analysis pipelines. This platform integrates various data sources, facilitating efficient data management and retrieval, ultimately aiding in the drug discovery process.

## Features
### Data Ingestion: Scripts for ingesting various data sources into the knowledge graph.
### Graph Construction: Tools to build and update the knowledge graph structure.
### Query Templates: Predefined Cypher queries for efficient data retrieval.
### Integration: Scripts for integrating external data sources.
### Documentation: Comprehensive guides and tutorials for setup and usage.
### Testing Suite: Unit and integration tests to ensure code quality and reliability.

## Technologies Used
Python: Primary programming language.
